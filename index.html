                I will develop any application you want. Within seconds. Give me a chance and I'll let you know why. Most of the time I code in Javascript. If you dont know what javascript is read this: JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.
